# Study List
#2023-07-22

As we are always learning new things, study list is a website to add these study subjects in a organized way, with lists, tags, and filters. 

The website has a counter for each subject, so every time a duplicated subject is added again, the counter will increase and the subject will be ordered by its counter, this way if you see that many companies are asking for postgreSQL, every time you add postgreSQL, the counter of the current subject will be increased, making it apear more on top of the list, so now you know what could be a good thing to learn next.

> I'm building this app to learn postgreSQL and Prisma. I want to have a better understanding about database, how they work and how should I work with them.
